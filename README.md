This is a pet-project IoT LoRa Labkit for SibSAU. 
Based on LwIP 6LoWPAN + LoRa PHY.
Base station should be connected through PPPoS to a PC.

Main goals of this project:
- Learn basics of Makefiles. Create usable project structure with MakeFiles.
- Take a closer look at LwIP network stack. Try to create some network interface drivers.
- Create a adaptation layer LoRa <==> IEEE 802.15.4.
- Get some fun to working with this :)

Here is a to-do list:
- [x] FreeRTOS based minimal project with make script and CMSIS. 
- [x] USART driver
- [x] Porting LwIP 
- [x] Create pppos netif
- [ ] LoRa driver
- [ ] LoRa <==> IEEE 802.15.4 layer
- [ ] Ping from one wireless node to another
---------------------------------
- [ ] CoAP
